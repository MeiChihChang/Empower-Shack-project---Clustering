# Clustering
Clusters of neighborhood preferences for urban planning by C#

## Aim
Empower Schack Project --
The aim of this clustering component was to ensure that people living in the neighbourhoods could create or preserve communities. For this, we proposed a social network and integrated cognitive analysis to help arrange how people live together and in consequence support an intimate relationship in the community.

## Methodology
Distributing the same cluster of residents in proper building locations needed to confirm that each building had a shortest path between them. The measurement of distance in urban space depends on the cognitive distance, which represents a better empirical model of pedestrian movement than metric distance. 

For the computation of angular distances in Grasshopper we used the components developed by Fuchkina. The ranked-shortest path for all buildings allowed to map the household clusters into nearby buildings.
 
The optimized cluster layout was limited by the minimum total metric area size, which allowed to create a more dense living arrangement. This method assisted the urban planner in allocating residents close to each other according to preferences in combination with an efficient plot packing strategy
